## Project summary

### The issue we are hoping to solve

Water scarcity is a significant issue in many parts of the world, especially in rural and semi-urban areas. In regions in Africa like Kenya, communities face challenges accessing clean water, leading to health risks and decreased quality of life. Efficient water management is crucial for sustainability, especially in areas prone to droughts and inconsistent rainfall.




### How our technology solution can help

HydroConnect empowers communities with AI-driven tools to monitor and manage water resources efficiently.


### Our idea

Water scarcity is one of the greatest challenges facing global communities today, with over 2 billion people lacking access to clean, safe drinking water. In many developing regions, such as rural and semi-urban areas in Kenya, water management systems are either outdated, non-existent, or poorly maintained. This leads to inefficient water usage, with communities relying on manual processes to gather water, often traveling long distances. Moreover, inconsistent water supply due to poor infrastructure and climate challenges exacerbates the problem.

HydroConnect is designed to address these inefficiencies by using AI and real-time data to enhance water resource management. Our platform enables users, water management organizations, and municipalities to monitor water consumption, predict future shortages, and optimize water distribution. By leveraging IBM’s Watson AI tools, HydroConnect provides predictive analytics, helping communities prepare for dry periods and conserve resources more effectively.
